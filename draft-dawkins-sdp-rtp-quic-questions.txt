  SDP Offer/Answer for RTP using QUIC as Transport - Design Questions
              draft-dawkins-sdp-rtp-quic-questions-latest

Abstract

   This document describes these new SDP "proto" attribute values:
   "QUIC", "QUIC/RTP/SAVP", "QUIC/RTP/AVPF", and "QUIC/RTP/SAVPF", and
   describes how SDP Offer/Answer can be used to set up an RTP
   connection using QUIC as a transport protocol.

   These proto values are necessary to allow the use of QUIC as an
   underlying transport protocol for applications that commonly use SDP
   as a session signaling protocol to set up RTP connections with UDP as
   its underlying transport protocol, such as SIP and WebRTC.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes these new SDP "proto" attribute values:
   "QUIC", "QUIC/RTP/SAVP", "QUIC/RTP/AVPF", and "QUIC/RTP/SAVPF", and
   describes how SDP Offer/Answer ([RFC3264]) can be used to set up an
   RTP ([RFC3550]) connection using QUIC ([RFC9000]) as a transport
   protocol.

   These proto values are necessary to allow the use of QUIC as an
   underlying transport protocol for applications that commonly use SDP
   as a session signaling protocol to set up RTP connections with UDP as
   its underlying transport protocol, such as SIP ([RFC3261]) and WebRTC
   ([RFC8825]).

1.1.  Notes for Readers

   This document is intended for publiication as a standards-track RFC
   in the IETF stream, but has not been adopted by any IETF working
   group, and does not carry any special status within the IETF.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

1.4.  Scope of this document

   This document focuses on the IANA registration and description of the
   RTP sessions using SDP Offer/Answer, as would be the case for many
   current RTP applications in common use, such as SIP ([RFC3261]) and
   WebRTC ([RFC8825]).

   This document is intended as complementary to
   [I-D.engelbart-rtp-over-quic], which largely focuses on RTP/RTCP
   encapsulation in QUIC datagrams, so that the SDP experts can focus on
   SDP offer/answer aspects, and the RTP experts can focus on RTP/RTCP
   encapsulation aspects.

1.5.  Assumptions for this document

   This document assumes that for RTP-over-QUIC, it is useful to
   register these AVP profiles using QUIC, in order to allow existing
   SIP and RTCWEB RTP applications to migrate more easily to QUIC:

   *  RTP/SAVP ("The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"), as
      defined in [RFC3711].

   *  RTP/AVPF ("Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control
      Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)"), as defined in
      [RFC4585].

   *  RTP/SAVPF ("Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport
      Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"), as defined
      in [RFC5124].

   This document assumes that any implementation adding support for RTP-
   over-QUIC could reasonably add support for BUNDLE ([RFC8843]), "rtcp-
   mux" ([RFC5761]).

2.  Identifiers and Attributes

   As much as possible, these are reused from other specifications, with
   references to the original definitions.

2.1.  Protocol Identifiers

2.1.1.  The QUIC proto

   The 'QUIC' protocol identifier is similar to the 'UDP' and 'TCP'
   protocol identifiers in that it only describes the transport
   protocol, and not the upper-layer protocol.

   An 'm' line that specifies 'QUIC' MUST further qualify the
   application-layer protocol using an fmt identifier, such as
   "QUIC/RTP/AVPF".  Media described using an 'm' line containing the
   'QUIC' protocol identifier are carried using QUIC ([RFC9000]).

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified
   by [RFC8866], that defines a new value for the QUIC protocol.

      media-field =         %s"m" "=" media SP port \["/" integer\]
                                SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

      m= line parameter        parameter value(s)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      <media>:                 (unchanged from {{RFC8866}})
      <proto>:                 'QUIC'
      <port>:                  UDP port number
      <fmt>:                   (unchanged from {{RFC8866}})

2.1.2.  The QUIC/RTP/SAVP proto

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified
   by [RFC8866], that defines a new value for the QUIC/RTP/SAVP
   protocol.

      media-field =         %s"m" "=" media SP port \["/" integer\]
                                SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

      m= line parameter        parameter value(s)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      <media>:                 (unchanged from {{RFC8866}})
      <proto>:                 'QUIC/RTP/SAVP'
      <port>:                  UDP port number
      <fmt>:                   (unchanged from {{RFC8866}})

2.1.3.  The QUIC/RTP/AVPF proto

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified
   by [RFC8866], that defines a new value for the QUIC/RTP/AVPF
   protocol.

      media-field =         %s"m" "=" media SP port \["/" integer\]
                                SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

      m= line parameter        parameter value(s)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      <media>:                 (unchanged from {{RFC8866}})
      <proto>:                 'QUIC/RTP/AVPF'
      <port>:                  UDP port number
      <fmt>:                   (unchanged from {{RFC8866}})

2.1.4.  The QUIC/RTP/SAVPF proto

   The following is an update to the ABNF for an 'm' line, as specified
   by [RFC8866], that defines a new value for the QUIC/RTP/SAVPF
   protocol.

      media-field =         %s"m" "=" media SP port \["/" integer\]
                                SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF

      m= line parameter        parameter value(s)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      <media>:                 (unchanged from {{RFC8866}})
      <proto>:                 'QUIC/RTP/SAVPF'
      <port>:                  UDP port number
      <fmt>:                   (unchanged from {{RFC8866}})

                                 Table 1

   This example is largely based on an example appearing in [RFC8866],
   Section 5, but is using QUIC/RTP/AVPF to support a newer codec.

   Because QUIC uses connections for both streams and datagrams, we are
   reusing two session- and media-level SDP attributes from
   [SDP-attribute-name] that were defined in [RFC4145] for use with TCP:
   setup and connection.

   This example SDP offer might be included in a SIP Invite.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers these protocols in the proto registry
   ([SDP-parameters]).

   *  QUIC (Section 2.1.1)

   *  QUIC/RTP/SAVP (Section 2.1.2)

   *  QUIC/RTP/AVPF (Section 2.1.3)

   *  QUIC/RTP/SAVPF (Section 2.1.4)

3.1.  Proto Registrations

   IANA is requested to add these protocols to the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Parameters proto registry ([SDP-parameters]).

                  +=======+================+===========+
                  | Type  | SDP Name       | Reference |

   *Note to the RFC Editor*

   Please replace "RFCXXXX" with the assigned RFC number, when that is
   available, and remove this note.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the QUIC protocol are described in the
   corresponding section in [RFC9000].

   Security considerations for the TLS handshake used to secure QUIC are
   described in [RFC9001].

   Security considerations for SDP are described in the corresponding
   section in [RFC8866].

   Security considerations for SDP offer/answer are described in the
   cooresponding section in [RFC3264].
